## Rising tensions:
During the first year of decline at Elist, we saw a 10% decrease in revenue from 10 to 9 million and a 15% decline in aov from 300 to 250. But, we saw a growth of 6% in number of orders from 34,000 to 36,000. 

## Climax
In our worst year (2022), we saw a 46% decrease in sales growth from 9,000,000 to 5,000,000. Additionally, we saw a 10% reduction in aov and a 40% decrease in order count.

## Possible reasons:
Covid impact on economic performance -> Massive economic downturn in 2022
Promotions? - are there seasonal promotions
Change in product preferences
Change in customer demographics
Faulty products

# Loyalty Programme
2019-2020:
The loyalty program has been underperforming compared to the non-loyalty across all of the 3 North Star Metrics (Revenue, AOV and order count)

2021:
We can see that the loyalty program overtakes the non-loyalty program in the revenue and order count.
Yet, the non-loyalty segment retains the AOV dominance, with a value of 261 vs 250.

2022:
In 2022, we can see the loyalty program continue the trend that first emerged in 2021, and overtake the non-loyalty program in Nov.

# Products
As we have been asked to work on Apple products, let's quickly compare our 3 main products (Macbook, iPhone and AirPods)

As we can see, AirPods are our most popular products by far, with iPhone coming second and MacBook last.

## Here are refund rates by product
As we can see the Macbook and the iPhone's refund rates have been decreasing since 2019 as seen below

Except for airpods which had an uptick in 2020, but declined from 2021 onwards

# Recommendations
Based on these insights, the team would like to make several recommendations across several areas:
1. Continue with the loyalty program
2. Perform further product analysis



## Challenges:
NaN values 
Lack of historical data - the absence of pre-Covid data for benchmarking
refund dates were in 2025

Question for transactions team:
0 dollar purchases
