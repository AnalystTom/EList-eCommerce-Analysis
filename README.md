# Summary of Insights
AceProducts Sales has been declining from previous years with 2022 sales and order count decreasing by 44% and 38% respectively from 2021. 27in 4K Gaming Monitor consistently has been the company's best-selling product (based on revenue), accounting for over 30% of total product sales each year, while Bose Soundsport Headphones has been the lowest, accounting for less than 1% of total product sales each year. We are seeing customers in the loyalty program generating more sales for AceProduct ($500K more in 2021) and spending more per order on average ($35 more in 2022) compared to those not in the loyalty program, suggesting that the loyalty program is trending positively and proving popular amongst our customers.

The products that have taken the longest to deliver have been Macbook Air Laptops, Apple iPhones and Samsung Charging Cable Packs, averaging 8 days compared to 7 days for all other products. While we continue to see strong ROI from marketing directly to consumers, our email marketing channel has been increasingly contributing more towards total sales, growing by nearly 50% in 2022 since 2019. Over 96% of total sales in 2022 were made on our website compared to our mobile app (4%).

# Recommendations
Based on these insights, the team would like to make several recommendations across several areas:

# Products:
AceProducts should consider making cuts to the Bose Soundsport Headphones product line. This product line has contributed less than 1% of total sales each year and has not shown any positive growth in either number of orders or sales. If we need to consider further aggressive cuts to product lines, Apple iPhone and the Samsung Charging Cable Packs should be next as these products contributed less than 3% of sales each year and took the longest to deliver to customers on average, which impacts customers' perception of our service negatively.
Loyalty Program:
The team recommends continuing with the loyalty program as customers in the loyalty program have shown to make more purchases on average and contribute to higher sales.
Operational Effectiveness:
As AceProducts continues to grow globally, consider assessing whether there are better national delivery partners we can work with. While our shipping times are on par with our largest eCommerce competitors, customers on average are increasingly expecting faster delivery times. There can be improvements made to our delivery network to align with growing consumer expectations.
Marketing Channels:
The team recommends continuing to make investments into the direct and email marketing channels. These continue to provide strong growth and contributions to sales. Consider decreasing marketing efforts on social media channels as sales attributed to these channels have accounted for less than 2% of total sales traditionally and declining even further in recent years.
Platform Improvements:
Our website continues to see strong demand for new accounts. We recommend enhancements to continue to be made to our website and mobile apps as both platforms continue to see strong growth.
